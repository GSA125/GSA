#TODO Project 3: Indexing and Slicing (6 points)
# Using the list_stuff 
# Task: Print the first 5 elements and the last 3 elements of the list.
# Requirements: Use slicing and indexing.

# Task: Use a for loop to find the sum of all the even numbers in the list.
# Requirements: Apply an if statement within the loop to check for even numbers.

#TODO Project 6: Filtering with List Comprehensions (10 points)
## Use number_list
# Task: Create a list that contains only the numbers greater than 15 from the original list, name that list as filtered_list.

#TODO Project 7: List inside a list (10 points)

#TODO Project 8: loops with Lists (15 points)
# Task: Write a loop that keeps removing elements from the list until the number_list contains only numbers less than 30.
# Requirements: Use while, pop(), remove(), del, sort().

#TODO Project 9: Custom Function (15 points)
# Create a copy of the values from the original number_list, and name it number_list_2
# Use the list number_list_2
# Task: Write a function that takes a list and prints a new list with the odd numbers doubled and even numbers unchanged.
# Requirements: Use list comprehension inside the function, and print().

#TODO Project 10: List Sorting and Methods (8 points)
# Task: Sort the number_list_2 in descending order and print the index of the highest and lowest values in the list.
# Requirements: Use sort(), index(), Hint: look for max() and min () functions.
